**US Medical Insurance Cost KL**

For the project Us Medical Insurance Cost, I have done the following to analysis data set given named “insurance.csv”.
-	I first compared the insurance cost for smoker vs nonsmokers.
-	Region Area smoker vs nonsmoker
-	Patients with no children that are smoker vs nonsmoker
-	Patients with children that are smoker vs nonsmoker
-	Children vs no children
-	Region Area insurance Cost
-	BMI cost between an interval of 10
-	Average age of people with kids and without (this might however be irrelevant)
-	Gender comparison and the cost for insurance.

This project was very straight forward, but to go into more detail more coding is required and is something I plan on exploring.
I first compared the difference between smoker vs nonsmokers and found that the cost of insurance is higher for those that smoke.  Even if we exclude the factor of having BMI and sex, we can show that the cost of insurance will be higher for those that smoke.  If we went into more detail, we could conclude that there could be more external factors that could makes the cost of insurance higher.  But overall conclusion we see that smokers pay more in insurance.  The evidence that backs this information, is the fact we tested region and children and still shows that smokers pay more in insurance.
While we also did a test with children vs no children, it does show that there isn’t too much of a difference in cost of insurance.  But if we add other factors like smoker, region, and sex there could be a possible chance but its hard to conclude any information based on test.
I would say that there is a lot of bias in this dataset depending on how we code our functions.  I would like to point out the BMI test that I did.  Even though the sample set is large, I would like to argue that BMI test is hard to conclude because sample set between each interval can be too small or too large. I could change the function to show different intervals but again I think it should still be Bias because our dataset it too spread out.



BMI BETWEEN 10-20
Sum of People: 41	 Sum of all insurance cost:$362,381.01 	 Average cost of insurance:$8,838.56 

BMI BETWEEN 21-30
Sum of People:592	 Sum of all insurance cost:$6,422,990.93 	 Average cost of insurance:$10,849.65 

BMI BETWEEN 31-40
Sum of People:614	 Sum of all insurance cost:$9,443,053.04 	 Average cost of insurance:$15,379.57 

BMI BETWEEN 41-50
Sum of People:88	 Sum of all insurance cost:$1,479,297.10 	 Average cost of insurance:$16,810.19 

BMI BETWEEN 51-60
Sum of People:3	 Sum of all insurance cost:$48,102.92 	 Average cost of insurance:$16,034.31 

Given the data below, we can see that the number of people with BMI between 10 – 20 and 51 – 60 have a significant lower amount of people. (In this case also 41 – 50) The dataset is kind of hard to stretch at this point because I think we would need to increase the sample size to eliminate Bias in this dataset.




Yes - Sum of peoople no kids: 115	 Sum of all insurance cost: $3,604,256.85 Average cost of Insurance: $31,341.36 

No - Sum of peoople no kids: 459	 Sum of all insurance cost: $3,493,813.14 Average cost of Insurance: $7,411.76 



With the data given above, we can see that 574 patients do not have children.  But about 459 people smoke and 115 do not.  Given that the number of people that do smoke and don’t smoke is a huge difference, we can still see that the sum of all insurance cost is nearly identical.  But the average is bigger for smokers.  That’s because within the dataset, we do have significant less amount of people that do smoke with no kids.  But if we were to increase the number of people with no kids that do smoke, we can observe that the sum of all insurance will be higher and the average cost will stay relatively the same area.
What is great about this dataset is we have close to equal number of males and females.  And when we looked up the difference between insurance cost for each gender. We concluded that regardless of kids or if they smoke, males do pay more on average than females. 
In conclusion, in order for us to dive more deeply into dataset, we would need to have more functions that would test more conclusion.  Smoker females vs smoker males, and so much more.  With the help of python though we can evaluate more data quicker and easier and see a clear difference between datasets.


Im kind of new to githhub so dont know if this is efficient.[For the project Us Medical Insurance Cost.docx](https://github.com/Klee1991/Us-Medical-Insurance-Cost-KL/files/10222811/For.the.project.Us.Medical.Insurance.Cost.docx)
